Password Generator Application

This Python script defines a simple GUI password generator application using the Tkinter library. The application takes an input for the length of the password and generates a random password based on a list of characters. The password can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on a button.
Prerequisites

Before running the application, you should ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

  Python 3.x
  Tkinter library

Usage

    pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the application, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script. Then, run the following command:

    python password_generator.py

Replace password_generator.py with the name of the script.
Customization

The script includes hard-coded configurations for each resource, which may not be suitable for all use cases. To customize the application, you can modify the script to change the configuration of each resource.
Best Practices

To ensure a secure password generation, follow these best practices:

  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to ensure the randomness of the generated password.
  Use a larger set of characters to generate a more secure password.
  Encourage users to use longer passwords to increase the security of their passwords.
  Warn users not to share their passwords and to use a different password for each account.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the execution of the application, refer to the Python documentation or the Tkinter documentation for troubleshooting steps.
